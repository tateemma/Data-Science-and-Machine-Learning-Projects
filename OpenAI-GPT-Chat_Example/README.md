# OpenAI GPT Chat Example

This is an example chat app using the [OpenAI Chat API](https://beta.openai.com/examples/default-chat). 
It uses the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) web framework.

I did this as a way to familiarize with the OpenAI API and to follow the course [AI Research Experiences](https://cs197.seas.harvard.edu/) offered at Harvard by Pranav Rajpurkar.
