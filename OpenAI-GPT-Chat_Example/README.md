# OpenAI GPT Chat Example

This is an example chat app using the [OpenAI Chat API](https://beta.openai.com/examples/default-chat). 
It uses the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) web framework.

I did this as a way to familiarize with the OpenAI API and to follow the course [AI Research Experiences](https://cs197.seas.harvard.edu/) offered at Harvard by Pranav Rajpurkar.

Instructions on how to get the API key, the requirements file and how to run the app are best explained in the OpenAI API [quickstart tutorial](https://beta.openai.com/docs/quickstart). Follow the quickstart guide and then edit the index.html and app.py files to reproduce this chat example.

This is what it looks like:

- User enters a prompt in the text box.

- The response is given after clicking the 'Get a response' button.

**The code used here is a combination of code from the OpenAI quickstart guide and the chat example.
